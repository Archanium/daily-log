daily-log
=========

Simple scripts to record daily activities, usually in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but just as easily in text.

To use, clone the repo into your working directory.

To start a new entry:

	$ ./new`

A new file will be created in `./daily/YYYY/MM` and be opened for editing.
